var a = "global";
{
    func showA() {
        print(a);
    }

    showA();
    var a = "block";
    showA();
}

# before adding the resolver, this code output "global" "block"
# after adding the resolver, this code output "global" "global", 
# which make more sense because when showA() is defined, the "a" point to outer "global", and a reference should be static.
